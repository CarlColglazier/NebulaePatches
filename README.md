This is my collection of patches for the [Qubit Electronix Nebulae
v2](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/shop/nebulae).

Some of the patches (especially those that run on Supercollider)
assume you are running the [alternative firmware by
TheTechnobear](https://patchstorage.com/nebulae-firmware-technobear/).
